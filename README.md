<br>**Sample Cataloging**</br>

Development of a database system for cataloging sediment samples from different regions of Brazil and the world. The project is being developed through the Unified Scholarship Program of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). The project is led by an undergraduate student from the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME-USP) and supervised by Dr. Christine Laure Marie Bourotte of the Sediment Cataloging Laboratory of the Institute of Geosciences (IGS).</br>
<br>The project was developed using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.</br>

<br>This version was a beta model that was briefly operational, but was later replaced by a PHP version, which was developed using the same concepts as this initial project.</br>
